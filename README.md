Joe's Glorious PKGBUILDs
========================

A compilation of pacman PKGBUILD files for use with Arch Linux.

This is my personal collection of these files for some of the software I use. As
such, some of these may already exist in the AUR but I've created them partly as
a learning experience and also just because packaging on Arch is a dream.
